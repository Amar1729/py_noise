# PyNoise

What is PyNoise?

PyNoise is a simple script written in Python that runs in the background visiting random websites for you.

Why would I want that?

On March 29th congress passed a law that makes it legal for your Internet Service Providers (ISP) to track and sell your personal activity online. This means that things you search for, buy, read, and say can be collected by corporations and used against you.

How do I use it?

1. Clone the repo
2. install the only dependency, selenium (pip install selenium)
3. run the script (python make_noise.py) when you start browsing the interet
4. close the window when your done
